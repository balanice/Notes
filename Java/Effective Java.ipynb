    "## Consider static factory method instead of public constructor.\n",

    "**Advantage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    One advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they have names.    \n",
    "    A second advantage of static methods is that, unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new object each time they're invoked.\n",
    "    A third advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they can return an object of any subtype of their return type. This gives you great flexibility in choosing the class of the reurned object.\n",
    "    A fourth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters.\n",
    "    A fifth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object nedd not exists when the class containing the method is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantage:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The main limitation of providing only static factory methods is that classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed.\n",
    "    A second shortcoming of static factory methods is that they are hart for programmers to find.\n"

Instead, use the static compare methods in the boxed primitive classes or the comparator construction methods in the Comparator interface."
